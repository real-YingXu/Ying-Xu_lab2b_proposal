2)Outline：

We plan to build a series of LEDs that may contain different colors light up in turn,and we will use sensors to control the led such as brightness detecting and gesture sensing. 

I think it‘s cool because there are several GPIO pins on QT-PY2040 which can drive different color LEDs to connect in parallel. When the sensor senses light changes, we will make the specific LED light up, which is the same as the lab1. Besides，we can design a program that the gesture sensor sense different gestures to light up different color LEDs. It’s very interesting to detect the brightness changes and make different gestures in many different scenes.

4）Question：

What’s value return to RP2040 when the sensor detects the brightness？

How many leds can be used mostly？

For the protective resistor selection, why should we only use the 330ohms and 1k ohms resistor instead of other values?
